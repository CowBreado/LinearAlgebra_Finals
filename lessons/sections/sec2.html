<h2>Matrix Notation & Terminology</h2>

<p>
    To understand how matrices function in mathematics, it is important to become familiar with the basic <strong>symbols</strong> and <strong>terminologies</strong> used to describe them. 
    A <strong>matrix</strong> is written as a collection of elements arranged in <strong>rows</strong> and <strong>columns</strong> and is usually enclosed in brackets such as [ ] or ( ). 
    Mathematically, a matrix is often denoted with an uppercase letter like <strong>A</strong>, <strong>B</strong>, or <strong>M</strong>.<br><br>
</p>

<p>
    A matrix that has <strong>m rows</strong> and <strong>n columns</strong> is called an <strong>m × n matrix</strong>, read as “m by n”. 
    For example, a matrix with 2 rows and 3 columns is written as a <strong>2 × 3 matrix</strong>. 
    Each number inside the matrix is called an <strong>element</strong>, and it is labeled using a pair of subscripts. 
    The element located in the <strong>i-th row</strong> and <strong>j-th column</strong> is written as <strong>a<sub>ij</sub></strong>.<br><br>
</p>

<p>
    In many textbooks, matrices are represented like this:<br><br>
</p>

<p style="text-align:center;">
    <strong>
        \( A = \begin{bmatrix}
            a_{11} & a_{12} & a_{13} \\
            a_{21} & a_{22} & a_{23}
        \end{bmatrix} \)
    </strong>
    <br><br>
</p>

<p>
    This example shows a <strong>2 × 3 matrix</strong>. 
    The first index refers to the <strong>row number</strong>, and the second index refers to the <strong>column number</strong>. 
    This notation helps us identify the exact position of any element, making matrix operations more systematic and organized.<br><br>
</p>

<p>
    In simpler terms, you can think of matrix notation like an <strong>address system</strong> for numbers. 
    Just as houses have a street and house number, each value in a matrix has a <strong>row number</strong> and a <strong>column number</strong>. 
    This makes it easy to point to a specific value and know exactly where it belongs in the grid.<br><br>
</p>

<p>
    For example, in a classroom attendance sheet, each row could represent a <strong>student</strong> and each column could represent a <strong>day of the week</strong>. 
    If you look at the entry located at row 3, column 5, that would tell you whether the third student was present or absent on the fifth day. 
    This simple idea is the foundation behind matrix notation and why it is used so widely in mathematics and data organization.<br><br>
