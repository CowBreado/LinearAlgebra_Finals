<h2>Finding Inverse of 2×2</h2>

<p>
    Finding the inverse of a <strong>2×2 matrix</strong> is straightforward thanks to a simple formula that makes this operation much easier than for larger matrices. 
    Once you learn this formula and understand when it applies, you'll be able to quickly find inverses of 2×2 matrices, which is useful for solving systems of two equations and understanding the concept of matrix inversion in general.<br><br>
</p>

<p>
    For a 2×2 matrix:<br><br>
</p>

<p style="text-align:center;">
    <strong>
        \( A = \begin{bmatrix}
            a & b \\
            c & d
        \end{bmatrix} \)
    </strong>
    <br><br>
</p>

<p>
    The inverse is given by the formula:<br><br>
</p>

<p style="text-align:center;">
    <strong>
        \( A^{-1} = \frac{1}{ad - bc} \begin{bmatrix}
            d & -b \\
            -c & a
        \end{bmatrix} \)
    </strong>
    <br><br>
</p>

<p>
    Notice that ad - bc is exactly the <strong>determinant</strong> of the matrix! 
    So this formula can also be written as:<br><br>
</p>

<p style="text-align:center;">
    <strong>
        \( A^{-1} = \frac{1}{\det(A)} \begin{bmatrix}
            d & -b \\
            -c & a
        \end{bmatrix} \)
    </strong>
    <br><br>
</p>

<p>
    This immediately shows why a matrix needs a non-zero determinant to have an inverse — you can't divide by zero! 
    If ad - bc = 0, then the denominator is zero and the inverse doesn't exist.<br><br>
</p>

<p>
    The pattern in the formula is easy to remember: 
    you swap the positions of a and d (the main diagonal entries), change the signs of b and c (the off-diagonal entries), and divide everything by the determinant. 
    This gives you the inverse matrix.<br><br>
</p>

<p>
    Here's a concrete example. 
    Let's find the inverse of:<br><br>
</p>

<p style="text-align:center;">
    <strong>
        \( A = \begin{bmatrix}
            3 & 1 \\
            2 & 4
        \end{bmatrix} \)
    </strong>
    <br><br>
</p>

<p>
    First, calculate the determinant: det(A) = (3)(4) - (1)(2) = 12 - 2 = 10. 
    Since the determinant is not zero, the inverse exists.<br><br>
</p>

<p>
    Now apply the formula. 
    Swap a and d (3 and 4), change signs of b and c (1 becomes -1, 2 becomes -2):<br><br>
</p>

<p style="text-align:center;">
    <strong>
        \( A^{-1} = \frac{1}{10} \begin{bmatrix}
            4 & -1 \\
            -2 & 3
        \end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix}
            \frac{4}{10} & -\frac{1}{10} \\
            -\frac{2}{10} & \frac{3}{10}
        \end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix}
            \frac{2}{5} & -\frac{1}{10} \\
            -\frac{1}{5} & \frac{3}{10}
        \end{bmatrix} \)
    </strong>
    <br><br>
</p>

<p>
    You can verify this is correct by multiplying A × A<sup>-1</sup> and checking that you get the identity matrix:<br><br>
</p>

<p style="text-align:center;">
    <strong>
        \( \begin{bmatrix}
            3 & 1 \\
            2 & 4
        \end{bmatrix} \times \begin{bmatrix}
            \frac{2}{5} & -\frac{1}{10} \\
            -\frac{1}{5} & \frac{3}{10}
        \end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix}
            1 & 0 \\
            0 & 1
        \end{bmatrix} \)
    </strong>
    <br><br>
</p>

<p>
    Perfect! The result is the identity matrix, confirming that we found the correct inverse.<br><br>
</p>

<p>
    Here's another example with a simpler result. 
    Find the inverse of:<br><br>
</p>

<p style="text-align:center;">
    <strong>
        \( B = \begin{bmatrix}
            2 & 3 \\
            1 & 2
        \end{bmatrix} \)
    </strong>
    <br><br>
</p>

<p>
    Determinant: det(B) = (2)(2) - (3)(1) = 4 - 3 = 1.<br><br>
</p>

<p>
    Inverse:<br><br>
</p>

<p style="text-align:center;">
    <strong>
        \( B^{-1} = \frac{1}{1} \begin{bmatrix}
            2 & -3 \\
            -1 & 2
        \end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix}
            2 & -3 \\
            -1 & 2
        \end{bmatrix} \)
    </strong>
    <br><br>
</p>

<p>
    When the determinant is 1, you don't need to divide, making the calculation even simpler!<br><br>
</p>

<p>
    Here are some key points to remember:<br><br>
</p>
<ul style="margin-bottom: 2em;">
    <li>Always check the <strong>determinant first</strong> — if it's zero, the inverse doesn't exist</li>
    <li>The formula: swap diagonal entries (a and d), negate off-diagonal entries (b and c), divide by determinant</li>
    <li>Remember to divide <strong>every entry</strong> by the determinant, not just some of them</li>
    <li>Always verify your answer by checking that A × A<sup>-1</sup> = I</li>
    <li>If you get fractions, it's often cleaner to leave them as fractions rather than decimals</li>
</ul>

<p>
    The 2×2 inverse formula is particularly useful for solving systems of two linear equations. 
    If you have a system represented by Ax = b, and A is a 2×2 invertible matrix, you can solve it by calculating x = A<sup>-1</sup>b. 
    This method is efficient and gives you insight into how matrix inverses relate to solving equations.<br><br>
</p>

<p>
    Mastering the 2×2 inverse formula gives you a solid foundation for understanding matrix inverses in general. 
    While larger matrices require more complex methods (like row reduction or adjugate matrices), the core concept remains the same: 
    find a matrix that, when multiplied by the original, gives the identity matrix.<br><br>
