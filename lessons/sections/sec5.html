<h2>Overview of Matrix Types</h2>

<p>
    Just as there are different types of numbers — whole numbers, fractions, decimals — there are also different <strong>types of matrices</strong>, each with its own special properties and uses. 
    Understanding these various types helps you recognize patterns, simplify calculations, and choose the right approach when solving problems. 
    Some matrix types are common and appear frequently, while others are specialized for particular applications.<br><br>
</p>

<p>
    The most basic way to classify matrices is by their <strong>shape</strong> or <strong>dimensions</strong>. 
    A <strong>square matrix</strong> has the same number of rows and columns (like a 3×3 or 5×5 matrix), while a <strong>rectangular matrix</strong> has different numbers of rows and columns (like a 2×4 or 3×7 matrix). 
    Beyond shape, matrices can be categorized by the <strong>values</strong> they contain and the <strong>patterns</strong> those values form.<br><br>
</p>

<p>
    Some matrices have special names because of their structure. 
    A <strong>diagonal matrix</strong> has numbers only along the main diagonal (from top-left to bottom-right), with zeros everywhere else. 
    An <strong>identity matrix</strong> is a special type of diagonal matrix where all the diagonal entries are 1. 
    A <strong>zero matrix</strong> (also called a null matrix) contains only zeros. 
    These special matrices act like the number 1 and 0 do in regular arithmetic — they have predictable effects when used in operations.<br><br>
</p>

<p>
    Other important types include <strong>row matrices</strong> and <strong>column matrices</strong>, which are sometimes called <strong>vectors</strong>. 
    A row matrix has only one row, while a column matrix has only one column. 
    These are particularly useful in applications like representing coordinates, storing data points, or working with systems of equations.<br><br>
</p>

<p>
    Some matrices have special properties related to symmetry. 
    A <strong>symmetric matrix</strong> is one where the entry in row i, column j equals the entry in row j, column i — essentially, the matrix looks the same when reflected across its main diagonal. 
    This property appears naturally in many real-world applications, such as distance matrices or correlation matrices in statistics.<br><br>
</p>

<p>
    Here's a quick overview of the main matrix types you'll encounter:<br><br>
</p>
<ul style="margin-bottom: 2em;">
    <li><strong>Square matrix</strong> — equal number of rows and columns</li>
    <li><strong>Rectangular matrix</strong> — different number of rows and columns</li>
    <li><strong>Row matrix</strong> — only one row</li>
    <li><strong>Column matrix</strong> — only one column</li>
    <li><strong>Diagonal matrix</strong> — non-zero entries only on the main diagonal</li>
    <li><strong>Identity matrix</strong> — diagonal matrix with all 1's on the diagonal</li>
    <li><strong>Zero matrix</strong> — all entries are zero</li>
    <li><strong>Scalar matrix</strong> — diagonal matrix where all diagonal entries are the same</li>
</ul>

<p>
    Why does this matter? 
    Different matrix types have different properties that make certain operations easier or possible. 
    For example, only square matrices have determinants, and only certain square matrices have inverses. 
    Understanding these types helps you know what operations you can perform and what results to expect.<br><br>
</p>

<p>
    Think of matrix types like different tools in a toolbox. 
    Just as you wouldn't use a hammer to tighten a screw, you wouldn't try to find the inverse of a rectangular matrix. 
    Recognizing the type of matrix you're working with helps you choose the right mathematical tools and avoid common mistakes.<br><br>
