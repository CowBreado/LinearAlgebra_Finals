<h2>Determinant of 2×2</h2>

<p>
    Calculating the determinant of a <strong>2×2 matrix</strong> is the simplest case and a great place to start learning about determinants. 
    The formula is straightforward and easy to remember, making it an excellent introduction to this important concept. 
    Once you master the 2×2 case, you'll have a solid foundation for understanding determinants of larger matrices.<br><br>
</p>

<p>
    For a 2×2 matrix, the determinant is calculated using a simple formula involving the four entries. 
    If you have a matrix:<br><br>
</p>

<p style="text-align:center;">
    <strong>
        \( A = \begin{bmatrix}
            a & b \\
            c & d
        \end{bmatrix} \)
    </strong>
    <br><br>
</p>

<p>
    Then the determinant is:<br><br>
</p>

<p style="text-align:center;">
    <strong>
        \( \det(A) = ad - bc \)
    </strong>
    <br><br>
</p>

<p>
    In words, you multiply the entries on the <strong>main diagonal</strong> (top-left to bottom-right: a and d) and subtract the product of the entries on the <strong>other diagonal</strong> (top-right to bottom-left: b and c). 
    This is often remembered as "ad minus bc" or described as the "cross product" of the diagonals.<br><br>
</p>

<p>
    Here's a concrete example:<br><br>
</p>

<p style="text-align:center;">
    <strong>
        \( \det\left( \begin{bmatrix}
            3 & 5 \\
            2 & 4
        \end{bmatrix} \right) = (3)(4) - (5)(2) = 12 - 10 = 2 \)
    </strong>
    <br><br>
</p>

<p>
    Notice how we multiply 3×4 (the main diagonal) and subtract 5×2 (the other diagonal). 
    The result is 2, which means this matrix has a non-zero determinant, so it's invertible. 
    If the result had been 0, the matrix would not have an inverse.<br><br>
</p>

<p>
    Here's another example with a negative result:<br><br>
</p>

<p style="text-align:center;">
    <strong>
        \( \det\left( \begin{bmatrix}
            1 & 3 \\
            4 & 2
        \end{bmatrix} \right) = (1)(2) - (3)(4) = 2 - 12 = -10 \)
    </strong>
    <br><br>
</p>

<p>
    The negative determinant (-10) tells us that this transformation would flip or reverse the orientation of shapes, in addition to scaling them. 
    The absolute value (10) tells us about the scaling factor.<br><br>
</p>

<p>
    One special case to remember is when the determinant equals zero. 
    For example:<br><br>
</p>

<p style="text-align:center;">
    <strong>
        \( \det\left( \begin{bmatrix}
            2 & 4 \\
            1 & 2
        \end{bmatrix} \right) = (2)(2) - (4)(1) = 4 - 4 = 0 \)
    </strong>
    <br><br>
</p>

<p>
    When the determinant is zero, the matrix is <strong>singular</strong> (not invertible). 
    This means the rows (or columns) are linearly dependent — one is a multiple of the other. 
    In this case, the second row [1, 2] is half of the first row [2, 4]. 
    Geometrically, a zero determinant means the transformation collapses the area to zero, squashing everything into a line or point.<br><br>
</p>

<p>
    The 2×2 determinant formula is easy to visualize. 
    You can think of it as finding the area of a parallelogram formed by the two column vectors (or row vectors) of the matrix. 
    If the vectors point in the same direction (making them linearly dependent), the area is zero. 
    If they point in different directions, the area is the absolute value of the determinant.<br><br>
</p>

<p>
    Here are some tips for calculating 2×2 determinants:<br><br>
</p>
<ul style="margin-bottom: 2em;">
    <li>Always use the formula: <strong>ad - bc</strong> (main diagonal minus other diagonal)</li>
    <li>Be careful with signs — subtracting bc means you're subtracting, not adding</li>
    <li>If the result is zero, the matrix is not invertible</li>
    <li>The absolute value tells you the scaling factor; the sign tells you about orientation</li>
    <li>Practice with different numbers to build confidence</li>
</ul>

<p>
    Understanding the 2×2 determinant is crucial because it's the building block for calculating determinants of larger matrices. 
    Many methods for finding 3×3 determinants (and larger) involve breaking them down into 2×2 determinants. 
    So mastering this simple case prepares you for more complex calculations.<br><br>
</p>

<p>
    In applications, 2×2 determinants appear frequently in solving systems of two equations with two unknowns, analyzing 2D transformations, and working with 2×2 matrices in various contexts. 
    The simplicity of the formula makes it easy to use in calculations and helps build intuition about what determinants represent.<br><br>
