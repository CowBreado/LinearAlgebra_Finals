<h2>Matrix Form of Systems</h2>

<p>
    One of the most powerful applications of matrices is representing and solving <strong>systems of linear equations</strong>. 
    By writing a system of equations in matrix form, you can use matrix operations to solve problems that would be tedious or difficult using traditional algebraic methods. 
    This matrix representation also makes it easier to understand the structure of the system and apply computational methods.<br><br>
</p>

<p>
    A system of linear equations can be written in the form <strong>Ax = b</strong>, where:
</p>
<ul style="margin-bottom: 2em;">
    <li><strong>A</strong> is the <strong>coefficient matrix</strong> — contains the coefficients of the variables</li>
    <li><strong>x</strong> is the <strong>variable vector</strong> — contains the unknown variables</li>
    <li><strong>b</strong> is the <strong>constant vector</strong> — contains the constants on the right side of the equations</li>
</ul>

<p>
    For example, consider this system of two equations:<br><br>
</p>

<p style="text-align:center;">
    <strong>
        3x + 2y = 7<br>
        5x - y = 1
    </strong>
    <br><br>
</p>

<p>
    In matrix form, this becomes:<br><br>
</p>

<p style="text-align:center;">
    <strong>
        \( \begin{bmatrix}
            3 & 2 \\
            5 & -1
        \end{bmatrix} \begin{bmatrix}
            x \\
            y
        \end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix}
            7 \\
            1
        \end{bmatrix} \)
    </strong>
    <br><br>
</p>

<p>
    Here, the coefficient matrix A contains the coefficients of x and y from both equations. 
    The first row [3, 2] comes from the first equation (coefficients of x and y), and the second row [5, -1] comes from the second equation. 
    The variable vector x contains the unknowns [x, y], and the constant vector b contains the right-hand side values [7, 1].<br><br>
</p>

<p>
    For a system of three equations with three unknowns, the matrix form follows the same pattern. 
    For example:<br><br>
</p>

<p style="text-align:center;">
    <strong>
        x + 2y + 3z = 6<br>
        2x + 5y + 2z = 4<br>
        -x + y + z = 0
    </strong>
    <br><br>
</p>

<p>
    In matrix form:<br><br>
</p>

<p style="text-align:center;">
    <strong>
        \( \begin{bmatrix}
            1 & 2 & 3 \\
            2 & 5 & 2 \\
            -1 & 1 & 1
        \end{bmatrix} \begin{bmatrix}
            x \\
            y \\
            z
        \end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix}
            6 \\
            4 \\
            0
        \end{bmatrix} \)
    </strong>
    <br><br>
</p>

<p>
    Notice how each row of the coefficient matrix corresponds to one equation, and each column corresponds to one variable. 
    This organization makes it easy to see the structure of the system and work with it using matrix operations.<br><br>
</p>

<p>
    The matrix form Ax = b is powerful because it allows you to use matrix algebra to solve the system. 
    If the coefficient matrix A is invertible (has a non-zero determinant), you can solve for x by multiplying both sides by A<sup>-1</sup>:<br><br>
</p>

<p style="text-align:center;">
    <strong>
        A<sup>-1</sup>(Ax) = A<sup>-1</sup>b<br>
        (A<sup>-1</sup>A)x = A<sup>-1</sup>b<br>
        Ix = A<sup>-1</sup>b<br>
        x = A<sup>-1</sup>b
    </strong>
    <br><br>
</p>

<p>
    This gives you a direct formula for the solution: x = A<sup>-1</sup>b. 
    This is much more systematic than substitution or elimination methods, especially for larger systems.<br><br>
</p>

<p>
    The matrix form also makes it easy to see important properties of the system. 
    The number of rows in A tells you how many equations you have. 
    The number of columns tells you how many variables you have. 
    If the system is <strong>square</strong> (same number of equations as variables), and A is invertible, there's exactly one solution. 
    If A is not invertible (determinant is zero), the system either has no solutions or infinitely many solutions.<br><br>
</p>

<p>
    In practical applications, systems of equations appear everywhere. 
    In <strong>engineering</strong>, they model circuits, structures, and fluid flow. 
    In <strong>economics</strong>, they represent supply and demand relationships. 
    In <strong>computer graphics</strong>, they solve for positions and transformations. 
    Writing these systems in matrix form makes them easier to analyze and solve using computational methods.<br><br>
</p>

<p>
    Understanding the matrix form of systems is the first step toward using powerful matrix-based solution methods. 
    Once you can write a system as Ax = b, you have access to all the tools of linear algebra — matrix inverses, determinants, row operations, and more — to find solutions efficiently and systematically.<br><br>
