<h2>Scalar Multiplication</h2>

<p>
    <strong>Scalar multiplication</strong> is one of the simplest and most useful matrix operations. 
    The word "scalar" refers to a regular number (as opposed to a matrix), and scalar multiplication means multiplying every entry in a matrix by the same number. 
    This operation is straightforward, intuitive, and appears frequently in matrix calculations and real-world applications.<br><br>
</p>

<p>
    To multiply a matrix by a scalar, you simply multiply <strong>every single entry</strong> in the matrix by that scalar value. 
    Unlike matrix addition, scalar multiplication doesn't require any special conditions about matrix dimensions — you can multiply any matrix by any scalar, regardless of its size. 
    The result is a new matrix of the same size as the original, where each entry has been multiplied by the scalar.<br><br>
</p>

<p>
    Here's an example of multiplying a 2×3 matrix by the scalar 3:<br><br>
</p>

<p style="text-align:center;">
    <strong>
        \( 3 \times \begin{bmatrix}
            2 & 5 & 1 \\
            4 & 3 & 6
        \end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix}
            3 \times 2 & 3 \times 5 & 3 \times 1 \\
            3 \times 4 & 3 \times 3 & 3 \times 6
        \end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix}
            6 & 15 & 3 \\
            12 & 9 & 18
        \end{bmatrix} \)
    </strong>
    <br><br>
</p>

<p>
    Notice how every entry gets multiplied by 3: 2 becomes 6, 5 becomes 15, 1 becomes 3, and so on. 
    This uniform scaling is what makes scalar multiplication so useful — it changes the magnitude of all values proportionally while preserving the structure and relationships within the matrix.<br><br>
</p>

<p>
    Scalar multiplication can be written in different ways. 
    You might see it written as 3A, 3 × A, or 3 · A, where A is a matrix and 3 is the scalar. 
    All of these notations mean the same thing: multiply every entry of A by 3. 
    The scalar can be placed before or after the matrix — both 3A and A3 mean the same thing (though 3A is more common).<br><br>
</p>

<p>
    Scalar multiplication has several important properties that make it easy to work with:<br><br>
</p>
<ul style="margin-bottom: 2em;">
    <li><strong>Distributive over addition</strong> — k(A + B) = kA + kB (you can distribute the scalar)</li>
    <li><strong>Associative with scalars</strong> — (kl)A = k(lA) (multiplying by two scalars is the same as multiplying by their product)</li>
    <li><strong>Multiplicative identity</strong> — 1 × A = A (multiplying by 1 doesn't change the matrix)</li>
    <li><strong>Zero property</strong> — 0 × A = O (multiplying by 0 gives the zero matrix)</li>
</ul>

<p>
    In practical applications, scalar multiplication is used for <strong>scaling</strong> or <strong>adjusting</strong> data. 
    For example, if you have a matrix representing prices in dollars and you want to convert them to cents, you multiply by 100. 
    If you have a matrix of measurements in inches and want to convert to centimeters, you multiply by 2.54. 
    If you want to increase all values by 50%, you multiply by 1.5.<br><br>
</p>

<p>
    Scalar multiplication is also used in combination with other operations. 
    For example, you might first add two matrices together, then multiply the result by a scalar. 
    Or you might multiply a matrix by a scalar before adding it to another matrix. 
    The distributive property tells you that these operations can be rearranged in useful ways.<br><br>
</p>

<p>
    Here's an example showing the distributive property:<br><br>
</p>

<p style="text-align:center;">
    <strong>
        \( 2 \times \left( \begin{bmatrix}
            1 & 3 \\
            2 & 4
        \end{bmatrix} + \begin{bmatrix}
            2 & 1 \\
            1 & 2
        \end{bmatrix} \right) = 2 \times \begin{bmatrix}
            3 & 4 \\
            3 & 6
        \end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix}
            6 & 8 \\
            6 & 12
        \end{bmatrix} \)
    </strong>
    <br><br>
</p>

<p>
    And this gives the same result as:<br><br>
</p>

<p style="text-align:center;">
    <strong>
        \( 2 \times \begin{bmatrix}
            1 & 3 \\
            2 & 4
        \end{bmatrix} + 2 \times \begin{bmatrix}
            2 & 1 \\
            1 & 2
        \end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix}
            2 & 6 \\
            4 & 8
        \end{bmatrix} + \begin{bmatrix}
            4 & 2 \\
            2 & 4
        \end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix}
            6 & 8 \\
            6 & 12
        \end{bmatrix} \)
    </strong>
    <br><br>

<p>
    Understanding scalar multiplication is essential because it's a building block for more complex operations. 
    It's also one of the operations that works the same way with matrices as it does with regular numbers, making it a comfortable starting point before moving on to operations like matrix multiplication, which has different rules.<br><br>
