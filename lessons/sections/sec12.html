<h2>Matrix Multiplication</h2>

<p>
    <strong>Matrix multiplication</strong> is one of the most important and powerful operations in linear algebra, but it's also one that confuses many students at first. 
    Unlike addition or scalar multiplication, matrix multiplication doesn't work element by element. 
    Instead, it combines rows and columns in a specific way that might seem strange initially, but makes perfect sense once you understand the pattern.<br><br>
</p>

<p>
    The first thing to know about matrix multiplication is that <strong>not all matrices can be multiplied together</strong>. 
    For two matrices A and B to be multiplied as A × B, the number of <strong>columns in A</strong> must equal the number of <strong>rows in B</strong>. 
    If A is an m×n matrix and B is an n×p matrix, then A × B is defined and results in an m×p matrix. 
    Notice how the "n" dimensions must match — this is crucial for the multiplication to work.<br><br>
</p>

<p>
    Once you've confirmed the dimensions are compatible, here's how matrix multiplication works: 
    To find the entry in row i, column j of the product A × B, you take the <strong>i-th row</strong> of A and the <strong>j-th column</strong> of B, multiply corresponding entries together, and add up all those products. 
    This is called taking the <strong>dot product</strong> of the row and column.<br><br>
</p>

<p>
    Here's a concrete example with two 2×2 matrices:<br><br>
</p>

<p style="text-align:center;">
    <strong>
        \( \begin{bmatrix}
            a & b \\
            c & d
        \end{bmatrix} \times \begin{bmatrix}
            e & f \\
            g & h
        \end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix}
            ae+bg & af+bh \\
            ce+dg & cf+dh
        \end{bmatrix} \)
    </strong>
    <br><br>
</p>

<p>
    Let's trace through how the top-left entry (ae+bg) is calculated: 
    Take the first row of the first matrix [a, b] and the first column of the second matrix [e, g]. 
    Multiply corresponding entries: a×e and b×g, then add them: ae + bg. 
    That's the top-left entry of the result. 
    The other entries follow the same pattern.<br><br>
</p>

<p>
    Here's a numerical example:<br><br>
</p>

<p style="text-align:center;">
    <strong>
        \( \begin{bmatrix}
            1 & 3 \\
            2 & 4
        \end{bmatrix} \times \begin{bmatrix}
            5 & 6 \\
            7 & 8
        \end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix}
            1×5+3×7 & 1×6+3×8 \\
            2×5+4×7 & 2×6+4×8
        \end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix}
            5+21 & 6+24 \\
            10+28 & 12+32
        \end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix}
            26 & 30 \\
            38 & 44
        \end{bmatrix} \)
    </strong>

    One crucial property of matrix multiplication is that it is <strong>not commutative</strong> — meaning A × B is generally <strong>not equal</strong> to B × A. 
    In fact, even if A × B is defined, B × A might not be defined at all (if the dimensions don't match in the reverse order). 
    This is very different from regular number multiplication, where order doesn't matter. 
    Always pay attention to the order when multiplying matrices!<br><br>
</p>

<p>
    However, matrix multiplication does have some useful properties:<br><br>
</p>
<ul style="margin-bottom: 2em;">
    <li><strong>Associative property</strong> — (A × B) × C = A × (B × C) (grouping doesn't matter)</li>
    <li><strong>Distributive property</strong> — A × (B + C) = A × B + A × C</li>
    <li><strong>Identity property</strong> — A × I = A and I × A = A, where I is the identity matrix</li>
    <li><strong>Zero property</strong> — A × O = O and O × A = O, where O is the zero matrix</li>
</ul>

<p>
    In real-world applications, matrix multiplication represents <strong>composition of transformations</strong> or <strong>combining relationships</strong>. 
    For example, if one matrix represents how to transform coordinates in one step, and another matrix represents a second transformation, multiplying them gives you the combined effect of both transformations applied in sequence. 
    This is why matrix multiplication is so powerful — it lets you combine complex operations into a single matrix.<br><br>
</p>

<p>
    When learning matrix multiplication, it helps to think of it as <strong>combining information</strong>. 
    Each row of the first matrix represents one piece of information, and each column of the second matrix represents another piece. 
    The multiplication combines these pieces to produce new information. 
    This is why the dimensions must match in a specific way — you're connecting rows to columns, so the number of elements in each row must match the number of elements in each column.<br><br>
</p>

<p>
    Practice is key to mastering matrix multiplication. 
    Start with small matrices (2×2 or 2×3) and work through the calculations step by step. 
    Once you understand the pattern, you'll find that it becomes more intuitive, and you'll be able to work with larger matrices more confidently.<br><br>
