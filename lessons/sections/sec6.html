<h2>Row & Column Matrix</h2>

<p>
    <strong>Row matrices</strong> and <strong>column matrices</strong> are among the simplest and most useful types of matrices you'll encounter. 
    As their names suggest, a row matrix has only <strong>one row</strong>, and a column matrix has only <strong>one column</strong>. 
    Despite their simple structure, these matrices — often called <strong>vectors</strong> — are fundamental building blocks in linear algebra and appear in countless applications.<br><br>
</p>

<p>
    A <strong>row matrix</strong> looks like a horizontal list of numbers. 
    For example, [3, 7, 2, 9] is a row matrix with 4 elements. 
    It's written as a single row, and you can think of it as representing a single observation or data point. 
    In many contexts, row matrices are used to store coordinates, represent a single set of measurements, or encode information about one object or entity.<br><br>
</p>

<p>
    A <strong>column matrix</strong> looks like a vertical list of numbers. 
    For example, a column matrix with 3 elements might look like:<br><br>
</p>

<p style="text-align:center;">
    <strong>
        \( \begin{bmatrix}
            5 \\
            8 \\
            1
        \end{bmatrix} \)
    </strong>
    <br><br>
</p>

<p>
    Column matrices are particularly common in systems of equations, where each element might represent a coefficient or a constant. 
    They're also used to represent vectors in physics and geometry, where they can describe positions, velocities, or forces in space.<br><br>
</p>

<p>
    One important thing to remember is that row and column matrices are <strong>not the same</strong>, even if they contain the same numbers. 
    The matrix [1, 2, 3] (a row matrix) is different from the column matrix with elements 1, 2, 3. 
    This distinction matters when performing operations like matrix multiplication, where the orientation affects how the calculation works.<br><br>
</p>

<p>
    In practical terms, think of a row matrix like a <strong>single line in a spreadsheet</strong> — it contains information about one thing across multiple categories. 
    For instance, a row matrix might represent one student's test scores: [85, 92, 78, 90], where each number is a score in a different subject. 
    A column matrix, on the other hand, is like a <strong>single column in a spreadsheet</strong> — it contains one type of information for multiple items. 
    For example, a column matrix might represent all students' scores on the math test: [85, 72, 91, 88, 79].<br><br>
</p>

<p>
    Here are some key properties and uses:<br><br>
</p>
<ul style="margin-bottom: 2em;">
    <li><strong>Dimensions</strong> — A row matrix is 1 × n (1 row, n columns), and a column matrix is m × 1 (m rows, 1 column)</li>
    <li><strong>Vector representation</strong> — Both types are often called vectors and used to represent directions, positions, or data points</li>
    <li><strong>Matrix multiplication</strong> — Row and column matrices can be multiplied together in specific ways to produce useful results</li>
    <li><strong>Data organization</strong> — They're ideal for storing single observations or single variables across multiple cases</li>
</ul>

<p>
    When you multiply a row matrix by a column matrix (in that order), you get a single number called a <strong>dot product</strong> or <strong>scalar product</strong>. 
    This operation is extremely common in mathematics, physics, and data science. 
    For example, if you have a row matrix representing prices [10, 5, 8] and a column matrix representing quantities [3, 2, 4], multiplying them gives you the total cost: (10×3) + (5×2) + (8×4) = 30 + 10 + 32 = 72.<br><br>
</p>

<p>
    Understanding row and column matrices gives you a foundation for working with more complex matrix structures. 
    Many operations on larger matrices can be thought of as working with rows and columns individually, so mastering these simple cases helps you understand the more general principles.<br><br>
