<h2>What is Matrix?</h2>

<p>
    In many areas of <strong>mathematics</strong> and <strong>science</strong>, we often deal with sets of numbers that are connected to each other.
    These numbers can represent anything — from the position of objects in physics, to sales data in economics, to pixel values in computer graphics.
    When the information becomes too large or too complex, writing everything one by one becomes inefficient.
    This is where <strong>matrices</strong> become extremely useful. A <strong>matrix</strong> allows us to organize large quantities of related values into a clear, structured form, making calculations faster, cleaner, and far more manageable. <br><br>
</p>

<p>
    <strong>Matrices</strong> appear in nearly every discipline:
    <strong>engineering</strong> uses them to study mechanical systems,
    <strong>computer science</strong> uses them for graphics and algorithms,
    <strong>data science</strong> uses them to process large datasets,
    and <strong>artificial intelligence</strong> uses them to train neural networks.
    If you look at almost any modern technology, chances are <strong>matrices</strong> are working in the background.<br><br>
</p>

<p>
    A <strong>matrix</strong> is a rectangular arrangement of numbers placed into rows and columns.
    Each value in a matrix is called an <strong>element</strong>, and the position of each element is defined by its <strong>row number</strong> and <strong>column number</strong>.
    Matrices can vary in size — for example, a matrix with <strong>2 rows</strong> and <strong>3 columns</strong> is called a <strong>2×3 matrix</strong>.<br><br>
</p>

<p>
    <strong>Matrices</strong> are used to perform operations such as:<br><br>
</p>
<ul style="margin-bottom: 2em;">
    <li><strong>Addition</strong> and <strong>subtraction</strong></li>
    <li><strong>Multiplication</strong> by numbers or other matrices</li>
    <li>Finding <strong>determinants</strong></li>
    <li>Calculating <strong>inverses</strong></li>
    <li>Solving systems of <strong>linear equations</strong></li>
</ul>

<p>
    These operations allow us to represent and manipulate complex relationships in a compact and structured way.<br><br>
</p>

<p>
    In simpler terms, a <strong>matrix</strong> is basically a <strong>table of numbers</strong>.
    It looks like a <strong>grid</strong>, and each number has a specific spot in that grid.
    This grid makes it easier to work with many numbers at once, especially when those numbers are related.
    Instead of solving equations one by one or handling data piece by piece, matrices let you treat the whole group at the same time.<br><br>
</p>

<p>
    Suppose you want to store information about the grades of <strong>three students</strong> in <strong>two different subjects</strong>.
    Instead of listing everything separately, you can place them into a <strong>matrix</strong> like this:<br><br>
</p>
<ul style="margin-bottom: 2em;">
    <li>Each <strong>row</strong> represents one student</li>
    <li>Each <strong>column</strong> represents a subject</li>
    <li>Each number is the <strong>score</strong> they received</li>
</ul>

<p>
    This matrix organizes all the information clearly, and later you can perform operations on it — like calculating <strong>averages</strong> or comparing <strong>scores</strong>.<br><br>
