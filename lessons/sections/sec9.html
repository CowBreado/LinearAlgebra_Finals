<h2>Diagonal & Scalar Matrix</h2>

<p>
    Some matrices have a special structure that makes them easier to work with and understand. 
    <strong>Diagonal matrices</strong> and <strong>scalar matrices</strong> are two such types that appear frequently in mathematics and applications. 
    They're called "diagonal" because their non-zero entries form a diagonal pattern, and this structure gives them useful properties that simplify many calculations.<br><br>
</p>

<p>
    A <strong>diagonal matrix</strong> is a square matrix where all entries are zero except those on the <strong>main diagonal</strong> (the diagonal running from the top-left corner to the bottom-right corner). 
    This means that in a diagonal matrix, the entry in row i, column j is zero whenever i ≠ j. 
    Only the entries where the row number equals the column number can be non-zero.<br><br>
</p>

<p>
    Here's an example of a 3×3 diagonal matrix:<br><br>
</p>

<p style="text-align:center;">
    <strong>
        \( D = \begin{bmatrix}
            d_1 & 0 & 0 \\
            0 & d_2 & 0 \\
            0 & 0 & d_3
        \end{bmatrix} \)
    </strong>
    <br><br>
</p>

<p>
    Notice how all the entries off the diagonal are zero, and only the diagonal entries (d<sub>1</sub>, d<sub>2</sub>, d<sub>3</sub>) can have any values. 
    This structure makes diagonal matrices particularly easy to work with. 
    For example, raising a diagonal matrix to a power is simple — you just raise each diagonal entry to that power. 
    Finding the determinant is also straightforward — it's just the product of all the diagonal entries.<br><br>
</p>

<p>
    A <strong>scalar matrix</strong> is a special type of diagonal matrix where all the diagonal entries are the <strong>same number</strong>. 
    In other words, it's like a diagonal matrix where d<sub>1</sub> = d<sub>2</sub> = d<sub>3</sub> = ... = k for some constant k. 
    Scalar matrices are essentially the matrix equivalent of multiplying by a regular number.<br><br>
</p>

<p>
    Here's an example of a 3×3 scalar matrix with the scalar value 5:<br><br>
</p>

<p style="text-align:center;">
    <strong>
        \( S = \begin{bmatrix}
            5 & 0 & 0 \\
            0 & 5 & 0 \\
            0 & 0 & 5
        \end{bmatrix} \)
    </strong>
    <br><br>
</p>

<p>
    When you multiply a matrix by a scalar matrix, it's equivalent to multiplying the entire matrix by that scalar value. 
    For example, multiplying any 3×3 matrix A by the scalar matrix S (with value 5) gives you 5A — every entry in A gets multiplied by 5. 
    This is why they're called "scalar" matrices — they scale (multiply) everything by the same factor.<br><br>
</p>

<p>
    The <strong>identity matrix</strong> you learned about earlier is actually a special case of a scalar matrix where the scalar value is 1. 
    So the identity matrix is both a diagonal matrix and a scalar matrix with value 1. 
    This connection helps you see how these different matrix types relate to each other.<br><br>
</p>

<p>
    Here are some key properties and uses:<br><br>
</p>
<ul style="margin-bottom: 2em;">
    <li><strong>Diagonal matrices</strong> — Non-zero entries only on the main diagonal; easy to raise to powers and find determinants</li>
    <li><strong>Scalar matrices</strong> — All diagonal entries are the same; multiplying by a scalar matrix scales the entire matrix</li>
    <li>Both are always square matrices</li>
    <li>Determinant of a diagonal matrix = product of diagonal entries</li>
    <li>Diagonal matrices are used in eigenvalue problems, scaling transformations, and simplifying calculations</li>
</ul>

<p>
    In practical applications, diagonal matrices often represent <strong>scaling operations</strong> — stretching or compressing along different axes. 
    For example, in computer graphics, a diagonal matrix might scale an image differently in the horizontal and vertical directions. 
    If all the diagonal entries are the same (making it a scalar matrix), the scaling is uniform in all directions, like zooming in or out equally.<br><br>
</p>

<p>
    One important property of diagonal matrices is that they <strong>commute</strong> with other diagonal matrices — meaning the order of multiplication doesn't matter. 
    If D<sub>1</sub> and D<sub>2</sub> are both diagonal matrices, then D<sub>1</sub> × D<sub>2</sub> = D<sub>2</sub> × D<sub>1</sub>. 
    This property doesn't hold for most matrices, which makes diagonal matrices particularly nice to work with.<br><br>
</p>

<p>
    Understanding diagonal and scalar matrices gives you insight into how matrices can represent simple transformations and operations. 
    They also serve as building blocks for understanding more complex matrix structures and operations that you'll encounter in advanced topics.<br><br>
