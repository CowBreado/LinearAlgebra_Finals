<h2>Square & Rectangular Matrix</h2>

<p>
    One of the most fundamental ways to classify matrices is by their <strong>shape</strong> — specifically, whether they have the same number of rows and columns or different numbers. 
    This simple distinction leads to two important categories: <strong>square matrices</strong> and <strong>rectangular matrices</strong>. 
    Understanding the difference between these types is crucial because many matrix operations only work with square matrices.<br><br>
</p>

<p>
    A <strong>square matrix</strong> has the same number of rows and columns. 
    Examples include 2×2, 3×3, 4×4, or any n×n matrix. 
    Square matrices are special because they're the only type that can have certain properties like <strong>determinants</strong> and <strong>inverses</strong>. 
    They also appear frequently in applications involving rotations, transformations, and systems of equations where the number of equations equals the number of unknowns.<br><br>
</p>

<p>
    Here's an example of a 3×3 square matrix:<br><br>
</p>

<p style="text-align:center;">
    <strong>
        \( A = \begin{bmatrix}
            a_{11} & a_{12} & a_{13} \\
            a_{21} & a_{22} & a_{23} \\
            a_{31} & a_{32} & a_{33}
        \end{bmatrix} \)
    </strong>
    <br><br>
</p>

<p>
    Notice how it forms a perfect square shape. 
    The diagonal running from the top-left to bottom-right (a<sub>11</sub>, a<sub>22</sub>, a<sub>33</sub>) is called the <strong>main diagonal</strong>, and it plays an important role in many operations involving square matrices.<br><br>
</p>

<p>
    A <strong>rectangular matrix</strong>, on the other hand, has a different number of rows and columns. 
    Examples include 2×3, 3×5, 4×2, or any m×n matrix where m ≠ n. 
    Rectangular matrices are very common in data analysis, where you might have different numbers of observations (rows) and variables (columns). 
    They're also used in systems of equations where the number of equations doesn't match the number of variables.<br><br>
</p>

<p>
    Here's an example of a 2×4 rectangular matrix:<br><br>
</p>

<p style="text-align:center;">
    <strong>
        \( B = \begin{bmatrix}
            b_{11} & b_{12} & b_{13} & b_{14} \\
            b_{21} & b_{22} & b_{23} & b_{24}
        \end{bmatrix} \)
    </strong>
    <br><br>
</p>

<p>
    The key difference in terms of operations is that <strong>only square matrices have determinants and inverses</strong>. 
    You can add, subtract, and multiply rectangular matrices (following the rules for matrix operations), but concepts like the determinant and matrix inverse are defined only for square matrices. 
    This is because these operations require the matrix to have certain symmetry properties that only square matrices possess.<br><br>
</p>

<p>
    In real-world terms, think of square matrices like <strong>square tables</strong> where you have the same number of people sitting on each side. 
    This symmetry allows for certain operations that wouldn't make sense with a rectangular table. 
    Rectangular matrices are like <strong>rectangular tables</strong> — still useful, but with different properties and limitations.<br><br>
</p>

<p>
    Here are some important points to remember:<br><br>
</p>
<ul style="margin-bottom: 2em;">
    <li><strong>Square matrices</strong> (n×n) can have determinants and inverses</li>
    <li><strong>Rectangular matrices</strong> (m×n where m≠n) cannot have determinants or inverses</li>
    <li>Both types can be added, subtracted, and multiplied (following matrix operation rules)</li>
    <li>Square matrices are common in transformations, rotations, and square systems of equations</li>
    <li>Rectangular matrices are common in data tables, overdetermined/underdetermined systems, and data analysis</li>
</ul>

<p>
    When you're working with matrices, always check whether you have a square or rectangular matrix first. 
    This will tell you immediately which operations are possible and help you avoid trying to perform operations that only work with square matrices. 
    Understanding this distinction is one of the first steps toward mastering matrix algebra.<br><br>
