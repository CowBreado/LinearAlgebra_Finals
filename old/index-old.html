                <p>To make learning even smoother, Linearity includes built-in interactive calculators that let you
                    experiment with matrices, check your answers, and visualize results instantly. Whether you're a
                    student brushing up for class, a self-learner exploring math fundamentals, or someone who just wants
                    quick and reliable matrix tools, Linearity gives you a simple, fast, and frustration-free way to
                    understand how linear algebra really works.</p>

                    powerful tools we use in science, engineering, data analysis, and beyond. At its core, linearity is
                    about relationships that behave predictably: when you double the input, the effect doubles with it;
                    when you combine inputs, their effects combine just as neatly. That simple structure is what makes
                    linear algebra such a reliable language for understanding complex systems.</p>
